        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5kg approx (1 x Pumkin, or 2 x Butternut Squashes)</li>
            <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 head of garlic, cut in half horizontally</li>
            <li>Handful of rosemary sprigs</li>
            <li>1½ tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
            <li>1 onion, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>30g Parmesan, freshly grated, plus a bit extra for garnish</li>
            <li>800ml hot ham stock or chicken stock</li>
            <li>100ml double cream</li>
            <li>15g butter</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 170C. Cut the pumpkin in half horizontally and remove the seeds - save them to make a snack (see tips below). Score the flesh, season with salt and pepper, then rub with the cut garlic halves. Lay rosemary sprigs and a garlic half in each pumpkin half. Drizzle with a little olive oil and place on baking trays.</li>
            <li>Roast the pumpkin halves for about 1 hour until tender; the timing will depend on the variety, density and thickness. It is ready when you can effortlessly slip a knife into the thickest part of the flesh. Take out the rosemary and garlic; reserve the garlic for later. While still hot, scoop out the pumpkin flesh and set aside. Discard the skins.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 1/2tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and cook for 5 - 6 minutes until soft and translucent. Scoop out the flesh from 2 or 3 roasted garlic cloves and add to the pan with the nutmeg and a little seasoning. Sauté for a further 1 - 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the soft pumpkin and Parmesan, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, lower the heat and simmer for 10 - 12 minutes. Stir in the cream and heat for a minute.</li>
            <li>In batches, ladle the soup into a blender and blend until smooth. Add the butter and blitz again to a velvety smooth texture. Pour the soup into a clean pan to reheat.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Tips from Gordon Ramsay</h3>
        <p>Roasting a pumpkin intensifies the rich, sweet flavour of its flesh which is lovely for soups but is also great as a filling for ravioli or making a delicious mash with butter, nutmeg and salt and pepper.’ Make extra and freeze in portions of two so you have easy lunch options to see you through the winter.</p>
